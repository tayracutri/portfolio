          I started taking programming courses in 2020. I always loved
          everything related to IT. This world amazed me. I decided I wanted to
          expand my knowledge and learn new technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did online courses for 2 years and a half. And I recently finished a
          full-time Coding Bootcamp of 600 hours.
